## robot-room
Code to demonstrate an algorithm for a robot to cover a room

**Setup**
```
npm install
```

**Run**
```
node index.js
```

**Running Custom Room**
In the `index.js` file, find the line at the top (~9) that calls the method to assign to the `grid` variable.  Here it is possible to load a custom grid rather than a randomly generated one (done by default).  You will see commented lines that demonstrate how to load a particular file.  Two example files are provided.
